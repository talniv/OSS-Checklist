OSS-Checklist
=============
The process for deciding whether to use OSS should include i think: 
    1. OSS licence review, specifically for any reciprocity provisions... 
    2. Mapping the contributors: Independent/not (is the code probably theirs to license as OSS in the first place) 
    3. All license mentions in code (not standardized)
    4. Code scan for a list of what's in the OSS package. 
    5. Search for the OSS and its different components to check use of others. 
    6. Reviewing the license terms of our product (to which we want to inject the contribution)  

Then we know.
