OSS-Checklist
=============
The process for deciding whether to use OSS should include: 
1. OSS licence review, specifically for any reciprocity provisions... 
2. Mapping the contributors: Independent/not (is the code probably theirs to license as OSS in the first place) 
3. All license mentions in code (not standardized)
4. Code scan for a list of what's in the OSS package. 
5. Search for the OSS and its different components to check use of others. 
6. mainly to see when they were published, and whether or not they have been litigated before. Fifth and last is reviewing the outbound licence terms â€“ namely, the license of the proprietary software designated to include the OSS in question, and advising on the necessary adjustments with regards to the OSS.
